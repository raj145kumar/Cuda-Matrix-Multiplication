# Cuda-Matrix-Multiplication

Matrix Multiplication on GPGPU in CUDA is an analytical project in which we compute the multiplication of higher order matrices. We performed the operations on both CPU and different GPUs and compare their results based on the time required for calculations and also calculated their CPU to GPU ratio.
